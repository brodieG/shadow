# Shadow

Over the past few months I've been resisting the urge to get distracted by the
pretty awesome work that @tylermorganwall has been doing with his [rayshader
package](https://github.com/tylermorganwall/rayshader).  His [blog
post](http://www.tylermw.com/throwing-shade/) introducing the topic is visually
stunning, accessible, and pedagogically effective (e.g. figure 5.).  So for the
past few months I've been admiring the lively reliefs that cropped up on twitter
and leaving at that.

Unfortunately (for me) at some point recently others got the idea to use the
`rayshader` algorithm demonstrate the [incorrigible slowness of
R](https://nextjournal.com/wolfv/how-fast-is-r-with-fastr-pythran):



that R is incorrigibly slow.

shading
algorithm used by rayshader is a great example of why R is slow and you should
use some-other-thing for your statistical programming 


But mo

It's great work, but I
have other things to
